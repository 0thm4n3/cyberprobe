<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Cyberprobe project is a distrbuted architecture for real-time
monitoring of networks against attack.  The software consists of two
components:
<ul><li>a probe, which collects data packets and forwards it over a network in
standard streaming protocols.</li>
<li>a monitor, which receives the streamed packets, decodes the protocols,
and interprets the information.</li>
</ul>
These components can be used together or separately.  For a simple
configuration, they can be run on the same host, for more complex environments,
a number of probes can feed a single monitor.
</p>

<p>The probe, <code>cyberprobe</code> has the following features:
<ul>
<li>The probe can be tasked to collect packets from an interface and forward
any which match a configurable address list.</li>
<li>The probe can be configured to receive Snort alerts.
In this configuration, when an alert is received from Snort, the IP
source address associated with the alert is dynamically targeted for a period
of time.  In such a configuration, the system will collect data from any
network actor who triggers a snort rule and is thus identified as a potential
attacker.
</li>
<li>The probe can optionally run a management interface which allows
remote interrogation of the state, and alteration of the configuration.  This
allows dynamic alteration of the targeting map, and integration with other
systems.
</li>
<li>The probe can be configured to deliver on one of two standard
stream protocols.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The monitor tool, <code>cybermon</code> has the following features:
<ul>
<li>Collects packets delivered in stream protocols.</li>
<li>Decodes packet protocols in and raises events in near-real-time.</li>
<li>Decoded information is made available to user-configurable logic to define
how the decoded data is handled.  A simple configuration language is used
(LUA) and example configurations are provided to monitor data volumes,
display data hexdumps, or stash the data in files.</li>
<li>Packet forgery techniques are included, which allow resetting TCP
connections, and forging DNS responses.  This can be invoked from your LUA
in order to fight back against attacks on your network.</li>
<li>Supports IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP and DNS protocols, currently.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The <code>cybermon</code> software is a bit of a work-in-progress at the
moment, and needs more protocols added, but there's enough capability to be
useful, and to demonstrate the value of this architecture.</p>

<p>The code is targeted at the Linux platform, although it is generic enough
to be applicable to other UN*X-like platforms.
</p>

<p>The easiest way to learn about the software is to follow our
<a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Cyberprobe started out as a research tool to study networked applications
to find out what they were doing, as we all know how software suppliers
sometimes like to add some "extras" to their software :).  So, a simple tool
to configure how packets are captured from a network was produced.  But as
you are probably aware, the biggest
threat to the safety of your information is from <u>outside</u> of
your network.  Thus, the ability to trigger collection of packets upon
detection of a Snort rule hit was added.
</p>

<p>Snort is a powerful IDS system which studies packets on your network,
analyses them against a set of signatures and creates logs and alerts.
We felt there was a need to harness the Snort alerts, but use them to
trigger collection and forwarding of packets from the address which caused
the alert.
</p>

<p>
You may be asking why you'd want to use Cyberprobe?  
After all, monitoring networks with tcpdump and Snort and collecting alerts and
packet data for analysis is a straightforward process for many networks.
However, real-time analysis is not possible if everything is file based.
Collecting the data and forwarding over the network to a central
collection point allows for a much more "industrialised" approach to intrusion
detection.  If you detect an attack attempt, and then observe vast quantities
of data leaving your network from the credit card accounts database, then
you know you need to act quickly.
</p>

<p>
You need flexibility about how you monitor for network attacks.  There isn't
a one-size-fits-all solution.  Attackers are ingenious in their approach to
attacking your network, so you need to have a flexible, configurable
monitoring tool to develop your defences.
</p>

<p>There's a war coming... The enemy is resourceful, they can use your 
networks and systems as their own weapon.  But with the right tools, you
can prepare a defence.  It's time to get ready for Cybermaggedon.

<p>Have a play, and let us <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/cyberprobe/discussion/">know what you think</a>.  We'd love to hear questions, comments, what's good, what disappointed you etc. etc.
</p>

<p>Powered by SourceForge, project page is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/cyberprobe">here</a>.

<h2>For improvement</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>While the system supports IPv6 match, it only supports IPv4 for
delivery.</li>
<li>Endpoint failure affects all endpoints.  (Not worth changing?)</li>
<li>The ETSI LI support is bare basics, for instance, doesn't support 
keep-alive.</li>
<li>The IPv6 matching has had little testing.</li>
<li>Cybermon needs more protocol capability e.g. SMTP support.</li>
</ul>
</p>
