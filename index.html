<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Cyberprobe project is:

<ul>
<li><p>A distributed architecture for real-time monitoring of networks against
attack.</p></li>
<li><p>A software-based probe, which collects packets from a set of
network interfaces, and any packets which match on a address map are
forwarded to an endpoint in a packet-streaming protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>The approach of configuring the probe to receive alerts from
snort. In this configuration, when an alert is received from Snort, the IP
source address associated with the alert is dynamically targeted for a period
of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Simple monitoring software which studies the collected data and
reports urgent threats which need to be investigated. (Bit of a work in progress at the moment).</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Cyberprobe also supports a management interface allow remote studying
or alteration of configuration.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Cyberprobe started out as a research tool to study networked applications
to find out what they were doing, as we all know how software suppliers
sometimes like to add some "extras" to their software :).  So, a simple tool
to configure how packets are captured from a network was produced.  But as
you are probably aware, the biggest
threat to the safety of your information is from <u>outside</u> of
your network.  Thus, the ability to trigger collection of packets upon
detection of a Snort rule hit was added.
</p>

<p>Snort is a powerful IDS system which studies packets on your network,
analyses them against a set of signatures and creates logs and alerts.
We felt there was a need to harness the Snort alerts, but use them to
trigger collection and forwarding of packets from the address which caused
the alert.
</p>

<p>
You may be asking why you'd want to use Cyberprobe?  
After all, monitoring networks with tcpdump and Snort and collecting alerts and
packet data for analysis is a straightforward process for many networks.
However, real-time analysis is not possible if everything is file based.
Collecting the data and forwarding over the network to a central
collection point allows for a much more "industrialized" approach to intrusion
detection.  If you detect an attack attempt, and then observe vast quantities
of data leaving your network from the credit card accounts database, then
you know you need to act quickly.
</p>

<p>There's a war coming... The enemy is resourceful, they can use your 
networks and systems as their own weapon.  But with the right tools, you
can prepare a defence.  It's time to get ready for Cybermaggedon.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
Usage:
</p>

<pre>
    cyberprobe &lt;config-file>
</pre>

<pre>
    cybermon &lt;port-number>
</pre>

<h2>Snort integration</h2>

<p>If the <code>snort_alert</code> element is specified in the configuration
file, Cyberprobe will
receive Snort alerts on a UNIX socket.  When an alert is received, the
source address of the IP is dynamically targeted for a short period of time.
The duration of targeting can be specified with the <code>duration</code>
element.  Note: when using Snort alerts, a delay should be specified with
the interface, to allow for the Snort processing latency.  1 second should
be fine.
</p>

<p>Snort should be run in IDS mode, with the UNIX socket alerting mode
enabled. e.g.</p>
<pre>
  snort -A unsock -N -l /var/log/snort/ -c snort.conf 
</pre>

<h2>Code</h2>


<p>You can either download the latest release on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberprobe/files/">downloads</a>
page, or checkout the latest code using git:
<pre>
git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/cyberprobe/code cyberprobe
</pre>
</p>

<p>Have a play, and let us <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/cyberprobe/discussion/">know what you think</a>.  We'd love to hear questions, comments, what's good, what disappointed you etc. etc.

<h2>For improvement</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>While the system supports IPv6 match, it only supports IPv4 for
delivery.</li>
<li>Endpoint failure affects all endpoints.  (Not worth changing?)</li>
<li>The ETSI LI support is bare basics, for instance, doesn't support 
keep-alive.</li>
<li>The IPv6 matching has had little testing.</li>
</ul>
