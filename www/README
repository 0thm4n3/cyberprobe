In here is a simple dynamic web page, that displays, in a browser an overview
of the information decoded by cybermon.  This is just a proof-of-concept.

To use this, download ElasticSearch, unpack it, and edit the configuration
file.  If you are already using ElasticSearch somewhere on your network, you
need to change cluster.name to some unique value (e.g. Cybermon) in
config/elasticsearch.yml, otherwise your ElasticSearch instance might join
another cluster.

Then, use cybermon with the cyberdb.lua configuration file.  The configuration
file has 'localhost' hard-coded into it, so you'd need to change that if
you want to use a remote ElasticSearch.

In a browser, load up www/index.html, and hopefully you should see a
simple scrolling visualisation.  Again, index.html has 'localhost' hard-coded
into it for the ElasticSearch instance, so you'll need to change that to
use it remotely.

Note: if you do this, ElasticSearch will make available, on your network,
raw data from your network.  Without any authentication scheme.  So, you
may not want to do this on your enterprise network.
